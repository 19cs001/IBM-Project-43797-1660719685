### Brainstroming

By posing a problem to a group of individuals or team members and engaging them in an open dialogue, the brainstorming approach allows for the generation of ideas. Agile Brainstorming is the name given to this method when it is used in agile projects since it may provide creative ideas. Our group speaks aloud each danger as it is identified. They can take notes so they won't forget a concept before their turn if an increased risk prompts a fresh thought for someone who is not yet in line.

### Customer Problem Statement

An issue that has to be resolved is described in depth in a customer problem statement. It considers how your product aims to address your customer's particular problems and pain points. A customer issue statement enables you and your team to comprehend the specific experience that you are trying to change via analysis and customer empathy. By analysing the issue and coming up with solutions before the product is fully developed, the statement helps to guarantee teams are concentrating on the proper thing during the innovation or development process.

### Empathy Map Canvas

Empathy maps are a straightforward, effective technique for developing knowledge of your people. Empathy, the capacity to comprehend another person's feelings and thoughts, is the name's etymological source. When grounded in actual data and used in conjunction with other mapping techniques, they can:
- * Eliminate bias from our designs and bring the team together around a single, shared knowledge of the user
- * Find the gaps in our study's findings
- * Find out what the user needsâ€”needs that the user may not even be aware of
- * Learn what motivates user action. Point us in the direction of genuine innovation
