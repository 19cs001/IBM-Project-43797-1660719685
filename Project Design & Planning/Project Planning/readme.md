### JIRA Files

### Jira Software

Jira is a piece of software for managing projects and keeping track of issues. Agile development teams frequently use the tool to keep track of bugs, stories, epics, and other tasks.

### Burndown Chart 

A burndown chart, which displays how quickly a team is working through a customer's user stories, is a project management chart. This agile tool records a feature's description from the viewpoint of the end user and compares the overall effort to the amount of work required for each agile sprint.

### Velocity Chart

The velocity chart's primary function is to provide a summary of the amount of work completed throughout each sprint. It will enable you to see clearly into the future and the workload of your staff.

You must provide the units of effort for each activity and the length of each interval in order to estimate and compute this statistic (the time). Each team member should communicate about the tasks that have been done or completed during the sprints. And the number of completed units of work is tallied at the conclusion of the period that we want to analyze.

### Project Planning

Project planning is a form of gradual, iterative project management. Agile allows for need modifications during the project and depends on ongoing feedback from end users rather than beginning with a detailed plan that is often product-related.
