### Problem Solution Fit

The concept of problem-solution fit refers to the teams ability to comprehend the demands, tasks, and consequences of your clients. Additionally, it implies that the team developed a unique solution to fulfil these demands, as suggested by client feedback (validation of desirability). This happens when there is proof that customers are interested in particular tasks, challenges, and rewards. You've established that an issue exists and created a value offer that takes into account the tasks, challenges, and gains of your consumers at this point.

### Proposed Solution 

Proposed Solution is the term for the technical response that the development team will offer in response to the Project's requirements and goals. The Vendor's proposed solution is referred to as the Proposed Solution when it includes all of the software, hardware, other products or equipment as well as any and all services (such as any installation, implementation, training, maintenance, and support services) required to put it into practice.

An architectural description of a particular solution is called a solution architecture. The enterprise solution architecture is combined with advice from many enterprise architectural views (business, information, and technical).
