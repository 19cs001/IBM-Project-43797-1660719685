Every interaction a customer has with a service, brand, or product is depicted visually in a customer journey map. The development of a journey map places the company in the consumer's head, allowing them to see and comprehend the processes, requirements, and perceptions of their customers.

### Data Flow Diagrams and User Stories

Data Stream The process model and data flow of the system are depicted using diagrams. The smallest piece of work in an agile system is a user story. It is a final objective, not a feature, as seen through the eyes of a software user. A user narrative is a casual, all-inclusive description of a software feature written from the viewpoint of the client or end user.

### Technology Stack

A collection of technologies layered one on top of the other may be used to create any kind of application. A technology stack, sometimes referred to as a technology infrastructure or solutions stack, is currently crucial for creating scalable, maintainable online applications. The sort of apps that the team may design, the degree of customisation the team can make, and the resources that the team require to develop the application are all influenced by the technology stack.
