### Assignment-3

###Problem Statement: Abalone Age Prediction
###Description:- Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is
determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through
a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain,
are used to predict age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food
availability) may be required to solve the problem.
###Attribute Information:
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, measurement unit, and a brief description. The number of
rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.
Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description
1- Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
2- Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
3- Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
4- Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
5- Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
6- Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
7- Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
8- Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
9- Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
