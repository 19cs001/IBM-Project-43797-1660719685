## Sprint

Agile projects are divided into small, repeatable periods called sprints or iterations, which are generally one to four weeks long. Projects are divided into manageable pieces during sprints. Teams only plan one sprint at a time, and they make adjustments for subsequent sprints based on the results of the preceding one. The number and duration of your project's sprints should be decided at the beginning, even though each sprint is planned separately.

## Testing

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating whether a software or application is bug-free, meets technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all exceptional and boundary cases.
